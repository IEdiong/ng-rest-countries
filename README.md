## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/) - For state management and data fetching
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - Frontend framework

### What I learned

I learnt a lot of things about RxJs and Angular.

### Useful resources

- [Filling a box with an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/Fill_a_box_with_an_image) - This allowed me to make the country flag fill the parent `div`. It enables consistent sizing of images despite the variations in the actual sizes of the different images. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
